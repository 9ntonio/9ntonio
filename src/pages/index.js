								Assurely is a small FinTech SaaS startup. Their focus is in insurance products and services. Some of my responsibilities were building the C# application front-end and also their React applications. Product & I would frequently collaborate on UI and other features which allowed for mutual ownership of the design process, which in turn created efficiencies in delivery times.

								Odopod was a mid-sized digital design agency that specialized in Human Centric Design. HCD is a problem-solving technique that puts people at the center. The goal is to keep usersâ€™ front of mind and seek solutions that create more intuitive and accessible products. As the Technical Director on this project, I worked with Google's engineers to meet their technical requirements & testing guidelines. The engineers & I created various proof of concepts that were tied to a suite of unit tests. This allowed us to test our architecture prior to kickoff and assisted in creating a smooth delivery process.

								The Odopod team and I built the iOS application for Sony's streaming service Vue. The application included live TV, DVR, and VOD features via a 3rd party content delivery service. As the Technical Director, I worked with Sony on the iOS and Chromecast builds while managing both internal and external engineering teams. I was also tasked to manage various design and engineering vendors and insure that they were meeting the brand guidelines set by Odopod.
