								Odopod was a mid-sized digital design agency that specialized in Human Centric Design. HCD is a problem-solving technique that puts people at the center. The goal is to
								keep usersâ€™ front of mind and seek solutions that create more intuitive and accessible products. As the Technical Director on this project, I worked with Google's
								engineers to meet their technical requirements & testing guidelines. The engineers & I created various proof of concepts that were tied to a suite of unit tests. This
								allowed us to test our architecture prior to kickoff and assisted in creating a smooth delivery process.
