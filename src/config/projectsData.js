The goal is to keep users' front of mind and seek solutions that create intuitive & accessible products. As the Technical Director on this project, I worked with Google's engineers to meet their technical & testing requirements. The engineers & I created various proof of concepts & prototypes that were tied to a suite of unit tests. This allowed us to test our architecture prior to kickoff and assisted in creating a seamless delivery process.`

      `In 1979 Factory Records released their 10th album Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division. The artwork is credited to both the band & Peter Saville. The album cover uses an image of radio waves from pulsar CP 1919. The background is black (instead of white) because Peter Saville said "I was convinced that it was just sexier in black". It is considered one of "the best albums of all time".`,
      `I'm obsessed with this album. So much so that for some time I've been trying to make an app that would use the album song's as the data for the waveform. I've tried before and hit walls. Recently I've started working on it again and with some help from Claude, a path was made. Read my post describing the process.`
