# Accessibility Improvements Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to fix the "Links do not have a discernible name" Lighthouse issue and enhance overall site accessibility for the Antonio Almena Portfolio.

## Project Context

The Antonio Almena Portfolio is a high-performance personal portfolio website that demonstrates technical expertise through both content and implementation. As part of achieving WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, comprehensive accessibility features have been implemented to ensure the site is usable by all visitors, including those using screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Links Without Discernible Names

**Problem**: Links that only contain icons, images, or unclear text don't provide enough context for screen readers.

**Solution**: Added `aria-label` attributes to all problematic links.

### 2. Icon-Only Links

**Before**:

```jsx
<OutboundLink href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-almena/">
	<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLinkedinIn} size="2x" />
</OutboundLink>
```

**After**:

```jsx
<OutboundLink
	href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-almena/"
	aria-label="Visit Antonio Almena's LinkedIn profile (opens in new tab)"
>
	<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLinkedinIn} size="2x" aria-hidden="true" />
</OutboundLink>
```

**Key Changes**:

- Added descriptive `aria-label` with context
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons
- Included "(opens in new tab)" for external links

### 3. Image Links

**Before**:

```jsx
<a href="https://store.google.com/">
	<StaticImage src="google.webp" alt="Google Store project showcase" />
</a>
```

**After**:

```jsx
<a
	href="https://store.google.com/"
	aria-label="Visit Google Store website (opens in new tab)"
>
	<StaticImage src="google.webp" alt="Google Store project showcase" />
</a>
```

**Key Changes**:

- Added descriptive `aria-label` explaining the link destination
- Maintained descriptive `alt` text for the image
- Clear indication of external links

### 4. External Link Indicators

All external links now include:

- `aria-label` with "(opens in new tab)" indication
- Proper `target="_blank"` and `rel="noreferrer"` attributes
- Descriptive context about the destination

## Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. Screen Reader Support

- **Descriptive Labels**: All links have clear, descriptive labels
- **Context Information**: Links indicate they open in new tabs
- **Icon Handling**: Decorative icons are hidden from screen readers
- **Meaningful Text**: Link purposes are clear from their labels

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

- All links remain keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators are preserved
- Tab order is logical and intuitive

### 3. WCAG 2.1 Compliance

- **Level AA**: Link purpose can be determined from link text alone
- **Level AA**: Links have sufficient color contrast
- **Level AA**: External links are properly indicated

## Testing Accessibility

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Build and test
yarn build:production
yarn serve

# Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
# Should now pass "Links do not have a discernible name" check
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Screen Reader Testing**:

    - Use VoiceOver (macOS) or NVDA (Windows)
    - Navigate through links using Tab key
    - Verify all links announce their purpose clearly

2. **Keyboard Navigation**:

    - Tab through all interactive elements
    - Ensure all links are reachable and functional
    - Verify focus indicators are visible

3. **Color Contrast**:
    - Check link colors meet WCAG AA standards
    - Test hover states for sufficient contrast

## Best Practices Applied

### 1. Descriptive Link Text

- Links describe their destination or purpose
- Context is provided for external links
- Technical jargon is avoided in labels

### 2. Consistent Patterns

- All external links follow the same labeling pattern
- Social media links have consistent structure
- Project links clearly indicate their type

### 3. Progressive Enhancement

- Links work without JavaScript
- Accessibility features don't interfere with visual design
- Screen reader users get equivalent information

## Expected Results

### Lighthouse Improvements

- ✅ **"Links do not have a discernible name"**: PASS
- ✅ **Accessibility Score**: 95+ (up from previous score)
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Improved external link handling

### User Experience

- **Screen Reader Users**: Clear understanding of link purposes
- **Keyboard Users**: Efficient navigation with clear focus
- **All Users**: Better context for external links

## Maintenance

### Adding New Links

When adding new links, ensure:

1. **Descriptive Labels**:

    ```jsx
    <a href="..." aria-label="Clear description of destination (opens in new tab)">
    ```

2. **Icon Links**:

    ```jsx
    <a href="..." aria-label="Descriptive label">
    	<Icon aria-hidden="true" />
    </a>
    ```

3. **External Links**:
    ```jsx
    <a href="..." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="...">
    ```

### Regular Testing

- Run Lighthouse audits after content changes
- Test with screen readers periodically
- Validate keyboard navigation paths
