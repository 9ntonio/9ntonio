# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The portfolio website shows a significant performance score discrepancy between local production builds (Lighthouse score: 100) and the live Netlify deployment (Lighthouse score: 75). This 25-point difference indicates deployment-specific performance issues that need to be identified and resolved to maintain optimal user experience and SEO rankings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the live site to load as fast as the local build, so that I have an optimal browsing experience regardless of how I access the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the live Netlify site is tested with Lighthouse THEN the Performance score SHALL be 90 or higher
2. WHEN comparing local vs live performance metrics THEN the difference SHALL be no more than 5 points
3. WHEN the site loads on mobile devices THEN Core Web Vitals SHALL meet Google's "Good" thresholds
4. WHEN analyzing network requests THEN there SHALL be no unnecessary or blocking resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify the root cause of the performance difference, so that I can implement targeted fixes rather than guessing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing local and live builds THEN all performance bottlenecks SHALL be documented
2. WHEN analyzing Netlify deployment THEN any deployment-specific issues SHALL be identified
3. WHEN reviewing network requests THEN any CDN or hosting-related problems SHALL be catalogued
4. IF resource loading differs between environments THEN the specific differences SHALL be documented

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site owner, I want automated performance monitoring, so that I can catch performance regressions before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is deployed to Netlify THEN performance metrics SHALL be automatically measured
2. IF performance scores drop below 85 THEN alerts SHALL be generated
3. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN specific recommendations SHALL be provided
4. WHEN fixes are implemented THEN before/after metrics SHALL be tracked

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized Netlify configuration, so that the deployment process doesn't introduce performance penalties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are deployed THEN they SHALL be properly compressed and cached
2. WHEN JavaScript bundles are served THEN they SHALL use optimal compression settings
3. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL use Netlify's image optimization features
4. IF there are Netlify-specific optimizations available THEN they SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on slower connections, I want the site to load efficiently, so that I can access content quickly regardless of my network speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site loads on 3G connections THEN First Contentful Paint SHALL be under 2 seconds
2. WHEN critical resources are loaded THEN they SHALL be prioritized over non-essential assets
3. WHEN fonts are loaded THEN they SHALL use proper display strategies to prevent layout shifts
4. WHEN third-party scripts load THEN they SHALL not block critical rendering path
