# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The portfolio website has image hover effects that are not working properly. Specifically, the `group-hover:scale-105` class is applied to StaticImage components, but the parent containers are missing the required `group` class, preventing the hover scale animation from functioning. This affects the visual interactivity and user experience of the portfolio showcase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio website, I want to see images scale up smoothly when I hover over them, so that I get visual feedback and an enhanced interactive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over any portfolio project image THEN the image SHALL scale up by 5% (scale-105) with a smooth transition
2. WHEN a user stops hovering over the image THEN the image SHALL return to its original size with the same smooth transition
3. WHEN the hover effect is applied THEN the transition SHALL use the existing duration-300 class for consistency
4. WHEN viewing on touch devices THEN the hover effect SHALL not interfere with touch interactions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the hover effects to use proper Tailwind CSS group utilities, so that the code follows best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing hover effects THEN parent containers SHALL have the `group` class applied
2. WHEN child elements need hover effects THEN they SHALL use `group-hover:` prefixed classes
3. WHEN multiple images have hover effects THEN they SHALL use consistent class patterns
4. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN it SHALL follow Tailwind CSS group utility conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor using assistive technology, I want the hover effects to not interfere with accessibility, so that I can navigate the portfolio effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hover effects are active THEN they SHALL not affect focus indicators or screen reader functionality
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN focus states SHALL remain visible and functional
3. WHEN hover effects trigger THEN they SHALL not cause layout shifts or accessibility issues
4. WHEN the page loads THEN all images SHALL maintain their accessibility attributes and alt text
