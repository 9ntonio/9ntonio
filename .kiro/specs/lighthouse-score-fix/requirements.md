# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The portfolio website currently has a Lighthouse performance score that needs improvement. Despite previous optimization efforts, specific issues remain that are preventing the site from achieving the target 90+ performance score. The audit identifies critical problems including large layout shifts (430ms savings), render-blocking resources (430ms savings), unused JavaScript (64KB savings), improperly sized images (94KB savings), and legacy JavaScript served to modern browsers (28KB savings).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the page to load without visual jumps or layout shifts, so that I have a stable and professional browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) SHALL be under 0.1
2. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL have proper dimensions set to prevent layout shifts
3. WHEN fonts load THEN they SHALL not cause text reflow or visual jumps
4. WHEN the particle system initializes THEN it SHALL not cause layout shifts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the page to start rendering immediately, so that I can see content as quickly as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN render-blocking CSS SHALL be eliminated or minimized
2. WHEN critical CSS is inlined THEN it SHALL cover above-the-fold content
3. WHEN non-critical CSS loads THEN it SHALL be deferred to avoid blocking render
4. WHEN JavaScript loads THEN critical scripts SHALL be prioritized over non-critical ones

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor on any device, I want to download only the JavaScript code that my browser needs, so that the page loads faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modern browsers access the site THEN they SHALL receive modern JavaScript without polyfills
2. WHEN unused JavaScript is detected THEN it SHALL be removed or code-split
3. WHEN third-party scripts load THEN they SHALL be optimized or lazy-loaded
4. WHEN the bundle is analyzed THEN unused code SHALL be identified and eliminated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want images to be appropriately sized for my device, so that I don't waste bandwidth downloading oversized images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are served THEN they SHALL be properly sized for the actual display dimensions
2. WHEN responsive images are used THEN they SHALL serve appropriate resolutions for different screen sizes
3. WHEN image formats are chosen THEN modern formats (AVIF, WebP) SHALL be prioritized
4. WHEN image quality is set THEN it SHALL balance file size with visual quality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the site, I want performance optimizations to be measurable and sustainable, so that I can track improvements and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the Lighthouse performance score SHALL be 90 or higher
2. WHEN changes are made THEN performance metrics SHALL be automatically monitored
3. WHEN the site is deployed THEN Core Web Vitals SHALL meet Google's thresholds
4. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL validate that optimizations remain effective
