# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The portfolio website's Lighthouse performance score has been diminished due to several optimization issues identified in the audit. The site needs performance improvements to restore high scores (90+) while maintaining functionality and visual quality. Key issues include layout shifts, render-blocking resources, unoptimized images, and inefficient caching policies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the page to load quickly without visual jumps or shifts, so that I have a smooth browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN there SHALL be no cumulative layout shift (CLS) issues
2. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL not cause layout shifts by having proper dimensions
3. WHEN fonts load THEN they SHALL not cause text to jump or reflow
4. WHEN the page renders THEN all elements SHALL have stable positions from initial load

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the page to load as fast as possible, so that I can quickly access the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN render-blocking resources SHALL be minimized or eliminated
2. WHEN JavaScript loads THEN it SHALL be optimized and minified for modern browsers
3. WHEN static assets load THEN they SHALL be served with efficient caching policies
4. WHEN text content loads THEN it SHALL be compressed for faster delivery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor on any device, I want images to be appropriately sized for my screen, so that I don't download unnecessarily large files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are served THEN they SHALL be properly sized for the viewport
2. WHEN responsive images are used THEN they SHALL serve appropriate sizes for different devices
3. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL use modern formats (WebP, AVIF) when supported
4. WHEN image optimization is applied THEN file sizes SHALL be reduced without quality loss

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the site, I want performance optimizations to be sustainable and not break existing functionality, so that the site remains maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance optimizations are applied THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN caching is implemented THEN it SHALL not interfere with content updates
3. WHEN optimizations are made THEN they SHALL be compatible with the Gatsby/Netlify stack
4. WHEN changes are deployed THEN the Lighthouse score SHALL be 90+ for performance
