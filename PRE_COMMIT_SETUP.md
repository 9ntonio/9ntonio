# Pre-Commit Hook Setup

## Overview
Added a comprehensive pre-commit hook that runs formatting and linting before each commit to ensure code quality and consistency.

## What Was Added/Modified

### 1. Enhanced Pre-Commit Hook (`.husky/pre-commit`)
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# Run pre-commit script which includes formatting and linting
npm run pre-commit
```

### 2. New Pre-Commit Script (`package.json`)
```json
"pre-commit": "npm run format && npx lint-staged"
```

### 3. Enhanced Lint-Staged Configuration (`package.json`)
```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{js,jsx}": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "prettier --write"
  ],
  "*.{json,md,css,scss}": [
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

### Pre-Commit Process:
1. **Format All Files**: Runs `npm run format` to format all files in the project
2. **Lint Staged Files**: Runs `npx lint-staged` to lint and format only staged files
3. **Auto-Fix Issues**: ESLint automatically fixes fixable issues
4. **Format Code**: Prettier ensures consistent code formatting
5. **Commit Proceeds**: If all checks pass, the commit proceeds

### Files Processed:
- **JavaScript/React**: `*.{js,jsx}` - ESLint + Prettier
- **Config/Docs**: `*.{json,md,css,scss}` - Prettier only

## Scripts Available

### Format Script:
```bash
npm run format
```
Formats all files in the project using Prettier.

### Pre-Commit Script:
```bash
npm run pre-commit
```
Runs the complete pre-commit process (format + lint-staged).

### Lint Scripts:
```bash
npm run lint        # Fix linting issues
npm run lint:check  # Check for linting issues without fixing
```

## Benefits

### Code Quality:
- ✅ Consistent code formatting across the entire codebase
- ✅ Automatic fixing of ESLint issues
- ✅ Prevents commits with formatting/linting errors
- ✅ Ensures all team members follow the same code standards

### Developer Experience:
- ✅ Automatic formatting on commit
- ✅ No need to remember to run format/lint commands
- ✅ Faster code reviews (no formatting discussions)
- ✅ Consistent code style across all contributors

## Testing the Setup

### Test the pre-commit hook:
```bash
# Make some changes to a file
echo "console.log('test')" >> src/test.js

# Stage the file
git add src/test.js

# Commit (this will trigger the pre-commit hook)
git commit -m "test commit"
```

The hook will:
1. Format all files in the project
2. Lint and format the staged `test.js` file
3. Proceed with the commit if everything passes

## Troubleshooting

### If pre-commit fails:
1. Check the error message in the terminal
2. Fix any linting errors manually if auto-fix didn't work
3. Re-stage the files: `git add .`
4. Try committing again

### Skip pre-commit hook (emergency only):
```bash
git commit -m "emergency commit" --no-verify
```

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `.husky/pre-commit` - Enhanced pre-commit hook
- ✅ `package.json` - Added pre-commit script and enhanced lint-staged config

The pre-commit hook is now fully configured to run the format script and ensure code quality on every commit!
